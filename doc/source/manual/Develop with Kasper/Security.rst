Security
=============

You can create a Kasper platform with a specific security configuration.
There is two strategies. One for Public resources calls identified by the @XKasperPublic annotation, and one for all calls.
This security configuration contains different callbacks interfaces allowing you to check some needs.
Those needs are :

   - SecurityTokenValidator to check the securtity token (not called for Public strategy)
   - IdentityContextProvider to set the user informations in the context
   - ApplicationIdValidator to check the applicationId
   - IpAddressValidator to check the ip address
   - AuthorizationValidator to check accesses to resource

These callbacks are called before query and command requests.
