=========================
Automated HTTP exposition
=========================

Kasper framework provides an exposition component allowing to automatically expose commands and queries.
Actually it is an HTTP exposition exchanging JSON messages + standard HTTP Headers and implemented via Java Servlets and a
databinding component mapping query strings and query POJOS. 

**Get it**:

::
   
   Gradle : 
      'com.viadeo.kasper:kasper-web:KASPER_LATEST_VERSION'

   Maven: 
      <dependency>
         <groupId>com.viadeo.kasper</groupId>
         <artifactId>kasper-web</artifactId>
         <version>KASPER_LATEST_VERSION</version>
      </dependency>


Goals
-----

 * Do all the work of exposing queries & commands by requiring 0 line of code from platform teams
 * Be easy to use on both platform and consumer side
 * Handle errors
 * Uniformize the communication
 * Be extensible in order to allow customization and extension/addition of new features.

Commands & CommandResult
------------------------

Commands are submitted using **POST** or **PUT** requests, there are no query parameters, everything is in the body.
Actually only json content is supported as input and output.

To enable Command exposition register **HttpCommandExposer** servlet, it will then use **DomainLocator** to locate each command handler.

Ex: the following command would be exposed at **http://host:port/someRootPath/createMember**

.. code-block:: java
   :linenos:

   class CreateMemberCommand implements Command {
     String name;
     // other fields
     
     // getters
   }

this command serialized in its json form would look like :

.. code-block:: javascript
    :linenos:

    {
        "name": "john"
    }

In response you receive a json of the following form (see :ref:`Error_codes`).

.. code-block:: javascript
    :linenos:

    {
        status: "ERROR" // values can be : OK, ERROR or REFUSED
        errors: [ // empty if status = OK
            {
                "code": "CONFLICT", // a mandatory human readable code, describing what is wrong
                "message": "user already exists", // a free technical message, providing more information on waht happened
                "userMessage": "You already have an account." // a optional free user facing message, can be sent/displayed to end users
            }
            // other errors
        ]
    }


Queries & Results
-----------------

A query is submitted using a **GET** request, the parameters will be in the query string not in the body.

This was the prefered way because we want to keep queries as simple as possible and we also think that using GET 
is handy with tools such as curl. Of course it imposes restrictions on having flat/simple queries and limited query size.

To enable Query exposition register HttpQueryExposer servlet, it will then use the **QueryServicesLocator** to locate each query service.

Ex: suppose we have the following query, it will be **available at http://host:port/someRootPath/getMemberMessages?memberId=999**.

.. code-block:: java
    :linenos:

    class GetMemberMessagesQuery implements Query {
        int memberId;
        Date startingFrom;

        // getters
    }

Query objects will be flattened by the framework to a query string, you should **avoid having complex structures**.

The framework will use the getters and setters during serialization/deserialization.

The framework also **supports deserialization to objects that don't have a default no arg constructor** (yay!) another handy feature :)

We might also add later support of ser/deser based on fields (being able to mix methods and fields or juste use one or another).

In case of an error a standard HTTP error code will be set with the reason for this error in the headers and the body will contain (optionally) more
information on what happened, see :ref:`Error_codes`.

.. code-block:: javascript
    :linenos:

    {
        "message": "Some query was not found...", // a technical global error message
        "errors": [ // can be empty
            {
                "code": "INVALID_INPUT", // awlays present, a readable code telling what happened
                "message": "Some technical message", // a detailed free technical message
                "userMessage": "Wrong email address?" // a optional free user message, can be displayed/sent to end users.
            }
        ]
    }

In case of a success a query Result will be returned serialized to json, this is done with Jackson. That allows you to use standard Jackson
annotations on your query Result (if you want to use constructors with args for example).

..  _TypeAdapters:

TypeAdapters
++++++++++++

Internally Kasper exposition layer uses what we call *TypeAdapters*, they allow to work parse/build queries from java types.

By default we provide a set of such adapters for most common types (primitives, dates, etc).

But you might need to define a **custom TypeAdapter** for types we do not handle yet (or just open an issue if it is a standard type so we'll add it).

Suppose you want to support URIs but there is no default adapter for this type:

.. code-block:: java
    :linenos:

    class URITypeAdapter implements TypeAdapter<URI> {
        @Override
        public void adapt(URI value, QueryBuilder builder) {
            builder.add(value.toString());
        }

        @Override
        public URI adapt(QueryParser parser) throws Exception {
	        // consume current uri value (will not be available anymore in the parser
            return new URI(parser.value());
        }
    }

To make your TypeAdapter automatically discovered you can use `Java service loader mechanism <http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/ext/basics/spi.html#register-service-providers>`_.
Just create a file named **com.viadeo.kasper.query.exposition.TypeAdapter** in **META-INF/services** (*must be exported in the final jar*)
and write the full name of each custom TypeAdapter (one per line) ::

    com.viadeo.somepackage.URITypeAdapter

The framework will automatically detect it, this is the standard java mechanism used in order to provide spi 
mechanisms for JSR implementors.

The framework will also handle null & missing values for you. 
During serialization you will never be called with a null value, and during deserialization you are sure that there is an actual value.

Complex Queries & BeanAdapters
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you need to support some complex query, we provide a way to do so by using custom BeanAdapters. 

Consider you want to have some kind of filtering.

.. code-block:: java
    :linenos:

    class SomeQuery implements Query {
        List<Filter> filters;
        String someField;
    }

    class Filter {
        String key;
        String value;
    }

Filter is not a standard type, but a POJO, we could handle it too, but it would encourage having complex queries.

To support it you will have to create a custom BeanAdapter.

.. code-block:: java
  :linenos:

  class ListOfFilterAdapter implements BeanAdapter<List<Filter>> {

    @Override
    public void adapt(final List<Filter> filters, final QueryBuilder builder, final BeanProperty property) {
      for (final Filter filter : filters) {
         builder.addSingle(property.getName()+"_"+filter.key, filter.value);
      }
    }

    @Override
    public List<Filter> adapt(final QueryParser parser, final BeanProperty property) {
      final String prefix = property.getName() + "_";
      final List<Filter> list = new ArrayList<Filter>();

      for (final String name : parser.names()) {
         if (name.startsWith(prefix)) {
            parser.begin(name);
            list.add(new Filter(name.replace(prefix, ""), parser.value()));
            parser.end();
         }
      }
      
      return list;
    }
  }

Then to register it, use the same mechanism as for TypeAdapters, the only difference here is that you must 
put your adapter into a file named **com.viadeo.kasper.query.exposition.query.BeanAdapter**.

..  _Error_codes:

Predefined Error codes
----------------------

For query & command errors some codes have been predefined, but users a free to use new ones.

| REQUIRED_INPUT
| INVALID_INPUT
| TOO_MANY_ENTRIES
| CONFLICT
| REQUIRE_AUTHENTICATION
| REQUIRE_AUTHORIZATION
| UNKNOWN_ERROR
| INTERNAL_COMPONENT_TIMEOUT
| INTERNAL_COMPONENT_ERROR
| INVALID_ID
