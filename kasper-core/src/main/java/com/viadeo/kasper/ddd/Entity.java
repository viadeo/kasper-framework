 * The base domain entity

 * An object that is not defined by its attributes, but rather by a thread of continuity and its identity.
 * 
 * Example: Most airlines distinguish each seat uniquely on every flight. Each seat is an entity in this context.
 * However, Southwest Airlines (or EasyJet/RyanAir for Europeans) does not distinguish between every seat; all seats are
 * the same. In this context, a seat is actually a value object.
