WARNING: now mainly outdated : TO BE REFACTORED

Use Case :

** Three Domains : "Facebook" contains "Timelines" and "Applications" domains

** "Timelines" domain contains two concept aggregates : "Timeline" and "Status"
   "Status" agregate contains a concept component "Media"
   
** "Applications" domain contains one concept aggregate : "Application"

** Than the following relations can occur :

- root relations :
	Member <- connected_to -> Member
	Member -- fan_of -> Application

- component relations :
	Application -- created_by -> Member
	Timeline -- owned_by -> Member
	Status -- attached_to -> Timeline
	Status -- published_by -> Member
